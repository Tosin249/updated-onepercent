            <h1>About One Percent Club</h1>
            <p>The One percent club is a worldwide association of entrepreneurs who are dedicated to helping individuals reach the top 1% of the world population. Only around 1% of the world population experiences the time freedom, financial freedom and mental freedom. They understand the real game of financial independence; the rest of the population are always in a desperate battle creating the future they want. </p><br><br>
            <p>Think about what you are doing and have done with your life so far. It’s a rather sad truth that most people will go through their life and never live the life they truly would love to live. They don’t drive the car they want to drive; they don’t live in the house they really want to live in. They don’t have the vacations they want to have;  you have to ask why…? </p><br><br>
            <p>You’ll find people living in the richest countries in the world, yet they are having difficulty getting by. The truth is you can literally create your own economy. It doesn’t matter what’s going on in the market place, it never really has mattered…</p><br><br>
            <p>You’ll also find in the very best economies people are failing miserably and yet in the very worst economies, people are earning millions of dollars. If you’re searching for answers, then you’re in the right platform and were ready to reveal the success secrets and help you find your path to the 1% community.
